# How to build the image : 

Without the builder
```bash
docker build -t php-symfony-apache:8.1.19 --build-arg FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19  --build-arg PHP_IMAGE_VERSION=8.1 . # Build for php version 8.2.1
docker build  -t php-symfony-apache:8.1.19 --build-arg PHP_BUILD_VERSION=8.1.19 . --no-cache # Build for php version 8.1.19
```

With the builder : 
```bash
./builder.sh -p 8.1.19
./builder.sh --php-full-version=8.1.19 
./builder.sh -h # Show Help
```




# Todo : 

- [x] Create dynamic env variable
  - Use via `ENV PHP_VERSION=${FULL_PHP_VERSION}` and $FULL_PHP_VERSION is given as a docker build arg (--build-arg FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19)    
- [x] Make `FROM php-xx` to use the var parsed
- [ ] Make the image work with `Symfony`
- [ ] Verify if the file used by `systemsdk/docker-apache-php-symfony` are correct. (file in `docker/*`)

# Improuvements : 

1. [x] Might be better to use a `Makefile` or a `.sh` to build the `Dockerfile` since we can't parse variable in the `Dockerfile`
Somethink like `./builder FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19`   
And the script will do somethink like :    
```sh
# VÃ©rifier si le premier argument est vide
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "usage : ./builder FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19" 
    exit 1
fi
#FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19
DOCKER_ARG_PHP_IMAGE_VERSION="PHP_IMAGE_TAG_VERSION=$(echo "$PHP_BUILD_VERSION" | cut -d. -f1,2)" # Result in DOCKER_ARG_PHP_IMAGE_VERSION=PHP_IMAGE_TAG_VERSION=8.1
DOCKER_ARG_FULL_PHP_VERSION="FULL_PHP_VERSION=$(echo "$PHP_BUILD_VERSION" | cut -d. -f1,2)" # Result in DOCKER_ARG_FULL_PHP_VERSION=FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19

docker build --build-arg ${DOCKER_ARG_PHP_IMAGE_VERSION} --build-arg ${DOCKER_ARG_FULL_PHP_VERSION}
# Will result in : 
docker build --build-arg PHP_IMAGE_TAG_VERSION=8.1 --build-arg FULL_PHP_VERSION=8.1.19
```
> This script can be usefull because we can't parse Variable in a Dockerfile, so the script is used to only give 1 arguments (AKA FULL_PHP_VERSION)   
> The script will parse the FULL_PHP_VERSION and exctract <PHP_IMAGE_TAG_VERSION> used for the FROM php-${PHP_IMAGE_TAG_VERSION}   



2. [ ] Instruction from `systemsdk/docker-apache-php-symfony` use the latest composer.  
Might be better to change it. We might need an other arg in the `Builder.sh` to do so.
> COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer



3. [x] Make an option for --no-cache for docker

# Issues : 
Not possible to parse variable in the dockerfile.    
I wanted to only give one variable with `--build-arg FULL_BUILD_VERSION=8.1.19`, and do :    
```Dockerfile
RUN PHP_IMAGE_VERSION=$(echo "$PHP_BUILD_VERSION" | cut -d. -f1,2) && \
    export PHP_IMAGE_VERSION && \
    echo "Exported PHP_IMAGE_VERSION variable with value : $PHP_IMAGE_VERSION" # So that PHP_IMAGE_VERSION=8.1
# To use like so : 
FROM php:${PHP_IMAGE_VERSION}
```
But it doesn work because :    
Each RUN statement in a Dockerfile is run in a separate shell. So once a statement is done, all environment variables are lost. Even if they are exported.   
So we can't parse FULL_PHP_VERSION to get only Major.Minor   


BuildKit is the builder for docker.     
> BuildKit only builds the stages that the target stage depends on.     

So if we build as usual, `BuildKit` will see that the `FROM debian` is not useful, and will not build the layer. And therefor, will not check if `--build-arg` is set correctly     

We can trick the builder to force the specific stage to build, AKAK DEBIAN_BUILD from `FROM debian:12-slim as DEBIAN_BUILD`. So we build like so `docker build --target DEBIAN_BUILD`.
Or, we could use the old BuildKit with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`, but : 
> The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.     
> BuildKit is currently disabled; enable it by removing the DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment-variable.
